  Abstract                 = {The ability of six human subjects to discriminate the velocity of moving sound sources was examined using broadband stimuli presented in virtual auditory space. Subjects were presented with two successive stimuli moving in the frontal horizontal plane level with the ears, and were required to judge which moved the fastest. Discrimination thresholds were calculated for reference velocities of 15, 30, and 60 degrees/s under three stimulus conditions. In one condition, stimuli were centered on 0° azimuth and their duration varied randomly to prevent subjects from using displacement as an indicator of velocity. Performance varied between subjects giving median thresholds of 5.5, 9.1, and 14.8 degrees/s for the three reference velocities, respectively. In a second condition, pairs of stimuli were presented for a constant duration and subjects would have been able to use displacement to assist their judgment as faster stimuli traveled further. It was found that thresholds decreased significantly for all velocities (3.8, 7.1, and 9.8 degrees/s), suggesting that the subjects were using the additional displacement cue. The third condition differed from the second in that the stimuli were “anchored” on the same starting location rather than centered on the midline, thus doubling the spatial offset between stimulus endpoints. Subjects showed the lowest thresholds in this condition (2.9, 4.0, and 7.0 degrees/s). The results suggested that the auditory system is sensitive to velocity per se, but velocity comparisons are greatly aided if displacement cues are present.},

  Abstract                 = {Minimum audible movement angles (MAMAs) were measured in the horizontal plane for four normal‐hearing adult subjects in a darkened anechoic chamber. On each trial, a single stimulus was presented, and the subject had to say whether it came from a stationary loudspeaker or from a loudspeaker that was moving at a constant angular velocity around him. Thresholds were established by adaptively varying stimulus duration. In experiment 1, MAMAs were measured as a function of center frequency (500–5000 Hz), velocity (10°–180°/s), and direction of motion (left versus right). There was no effect of direction of motion. MAMAs increased with velocity, from an average of 8.8° of arc for a target moving at 10°/s to an average of 20.2° of arc for a target moving at 180°/s. MAMAs were higher for a 3000‐Hz tone than for tones of lower or higher frequencies, as has been previously reported [D. R. Perrott and J. Tucker, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 83, 1522–1527 (1988)]. In experiment 2, minimum audible angles (MAAs) were measured with sequentially presented stationary tone pulses (500–5000 Hz), and were shown to exhibit the same dependence on signal frequency that the MAMAs showed (average MAA at 3000 Hz: 8.4°; average MAA at the other frequencies: 3.4°).
In experiment 3, MAMAs and MAAs were measured as a function of stimulus bandwidth (centered at 3000 Hz) and listening azimuth (0° vs 60°). Average MAAs decreased monotonically as stimulus bandwidth increased from 0 Hz to wideband (from 8.4° to 1.2° at 0° azimuth; from 11.3° to 1.5° at 60° azimuth). As in experiment 1, MAMAs increased with stimulus velocity, from values comparable to the MAAs for the slowest‐velocity (10°/s) targets to 70° of arc or more in the poorest condition (third‐octave band of noise presented at a velocity of 180°/s and an azimuth of 60°). MAMAs obtained in the slower‐velocity conditions depended in the same way on stimulus bandwidth and listening azimuth that MAAs depended on these variables. In no case was the MAMA ever smaller than the MAA. It is hypothesized that a minimum integration time is required to achieve optimal performance in a dynamic spatial resolution task. Average estimates of this minimum time based on the current data vary from 336 ms (for targets presented at midline) to 1116 ms (for narrow‐band targets presented at 60° azimuth). The relatively large magnitudes of these minimum integration times are consistent with the view of the binaural processor as a sluggish system.},

  Abstract                 = {One way the visual system estimates object motion during pursuit is to combine estimates of eye velocity and retinal motion. This questions whether observers need direct access to retinal motion during pursuit. We tested this idea by varying the correlation between retinal motion and objective motion in a two-interval speed discrimination task. Responses were classified according to three motion cues: retinal speed (based on measured eye movements), objective speed, and the relative motion between pursuit target and stimulus. In the first experiment, feedback was based on relative motion and this cue fit the response curves best. In the second experiment, simultaneous relative motion was removed but observers still used the sequential relative motion between pursuit target and dot pattern to make their judgements. In a final experiment, feedback was given explicitly on the retinal motion, using online measurements of eye movements. Nevertheless, sequential relative motion still provided the best account of the data. The results suggest that observers do not have direct access to retinal motion when making perceptual judgements about movement during pursuit.},

  Abstract                 = {When we make a smooth eye movement to track a moving object, the visual system must take the eye's movement into account in order to estimate the object's velocity relative to the head. This can be done by using extra-retinal signals to estimate eye velocity and then subtracting expected from observed retinal motion. Two familiar illusions of perceived velocity--the Filehne illusion and Aubert-Fleischl phenomenon--are thought to be the consequence of the extra-retinal signal underestimating eye velocity. These explanations assume that retinal motion is encoded accurately, which is questionable because perceived retinal speed is strongly affected by several stimulus properties. We develop and test a model of head-centric velocity perception that incorporates errors in estimating eye velocity and in retinal-motion sensing. The model predicts that the magnitude and direction of the Filehne illusion and Aubert-Fleischl phenomenon depend on spatial frequency and this prediction is confirmed experimentally.},

  Abstract                 = {During smooth pursuit eye movement, observers often misperceive velocity. Pursued stimuli appear slower (Aubert-Fleishl phenomenon [1, 2]), stationary objects appear to move (Filehne illusion [3]), the perceived direction of moving objects is distorted (trajectory misperception [4]), and self-motion veers away from its true path (e.g., the slalom illusion [5]). Each illusion demonstrates that eye speed is underestimated with respect to image speed, a finding that has been taken as evidence of early sensory signals that differ in accuracy [4, 6-11]. Here we present an alternative Bayesian account, based on the idea that perceptual estimates are increasingly influenced by prior expectations as signals become more uncertain [12-15]. We show that the speeds of pursued stimuli are more difficult to discriminate than fixated stimuli. Observers are therefore less certain about motion signals encoding the speed of pursued stimuli, a finding we use to quantify the Aubert-Fleischl phenomenon based on the assumption that the prior for motion is centered on zero [16-20]. In doing so, we reveal an important property currently overlooked by Bayesian models of motion perception. Two Bayes estimates are needed at a relatively early stage in processing, one for pursued targets and one for image motion.},

  Abstract                 = {The difference limen for the azimuth of a source of pure tones was measured as a function of the frequency of the tone and the direction of the source. Tone pulses between 250 and 10 000 cps were sounded in the horizontal plane around the head of a subject seated in an anechoic chamber. The smallest angular separation that can be detected between the sources of two successive tone pulses (the minimum audible angle) was determined for each of three subjects. These threshold angles are analyzed in terms of the corresponding threshold changes in the phase, time, and intensity of the tone at the ears of the subject. A comparison of these thresholds with those reported for dichotic stimulation indicates that the resolution of the direction of a source is determined, at frequencies below about 1400 cps, by interaural differences in phase or time, and at higher frequencies by differences in intensity. When the conditions are optimal for temporal discrimination, the threshold for an interaural difference in time is about 10μsec, and when the conditions are optimal for intensity discrimination, the threshold for an interaural difference in intensity is about 0.5 db.},

  Abstract                 = {Auditory resolution of moving sound sources was determined in a simulated motion paradigm for sources traveling along horizontal, vertical, or oblique orientations in the subjects’s frontal plane. With motion restricted to the horizontal orientation, minimum audible movement angles (MAMA) ranged from about 1.7° at the lowest velocity (1.8°/s) to roughly 10° at the highest velocity (320°/s). With the sound moving along an oblique orientation (rotated 45° relative to the horizontal) MAMAs generally matched those of the horizontal condition. When motion was restricted to the vertical, MAMAs were substantially larger at all velocities (often exceeding 8°). Subsequent tests indicated that MAMAs are a U‐shaped function of velocity, with optimum resolution obtained at about 2°/s for the horizontal (and oblique) and 7–11°/s for the vertical orientation. Additional tests conducted at a fixed velocity of 1.8°/s along oblique orientations of 80° and 87° indicated that even a small deviation from the vertical had a significant impact on MAMAs. A displacement of 10° from the vertical orientation (a slope of 80°) was sufficient to reduce thresholds (obtained at a velocity of 1.8°/s) from about 11° to approximately 2° (a fivefold increase in acuity). These results are in good agreement with our previous study of minimum audible angles long oblique planes [Perrott and Saberi, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 87, 1728–1731 (1990)]. In summary, the results suggest that: (1) the ability to detect motion is essentially independent of the path traveled by the source, with one noted exception, sources moving within a few degrees of the vertical plane and (2) auditory resolution of sound sources in motion is a U‐shaped function of velocity with resolution degrading as velocities increase or decrease beyond an optical velocity range.},

  Abstract                 = {In the future auditory directional cues may enhance situational awareness in cockpits with head-coupled displays. This benefit would depend, however, on the pilot's ability to detect the direction of moving sounds at different locations in space. The present investigation examined this ability. Auditory motion acuity was measured by the minimum audible movement angle (MAMA): the minimum angle of travel required for detection of the direction of sound movement. Five experienced listeners were instructed to indicate the direction of travel of a sound source (broadband noise at 50 dBA) that moved at a velocity of 20 deg/s. Nine azimuth positions were tested at 0 deg elevation. Five elevations were then tested at 0 deg azimuth. Finally two azimuth positions were tested at an elevation of 80 deg. The position of the source did not significantly affect the MAMA for azimuth locations between +40 and -40 deg and elevations below 80 deg. Within this area the MAMA ranged between 1 and 2 deg. Outside this area the MAMA increased to 3 to 10 deg.},
