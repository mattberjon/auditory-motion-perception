  Abstract                 = {The neural processing of auditory motion information shows a pronounced interhemispheric asymmetry. In previous electrophysiological studies, the so-called motion-onset response (MOR), a prominent auditory-evoked potential to the onset of sound motion, was stronger over the hemisphere contralateral to the side of motion. Here, effects of lateral-onset position and direction of motion on MOR contralaterality were investigated. Eighteen listeners were presented with free-field sound stimuli that, after an initial stationary phase at a lateral spatial position within the left or right hemifield, started to move either left- or rightward. The early part of the MOR, the so-called change-N1, exhibited contralaterality that depended on the lateral motion-onset position with stronger activations over the hemisphere contralateral to the side of motion onset, whereas the contralaterality of the later part of the MOR, the so-called change-P2, merely depended on the direction of motion. Cortical source localization indicated that this pattern of contralaterality primarily resulted from asymmetric activation in primary auditory cortex and insula. These findings suggest that the early and late parts of the MOR reflect different phases in auditory motion perception, supporting the notion of a modular organization of discrete processing stages.},

  Abstract                 = {The ear appears to have arisen early in the evolution of the vertebrates. While there are significant interspecific differences in ear structure, it appears that receptor cell structure and the basic function of the ear and auditory system are similar among all vertebrate groups. In this paper we present the evolution of the sensory hair cells of the ear, the origins of the ear itself, and selected functions of the sense of hearing. We argue that there have been strong selective pressures in most vertebrate groups for the sorts of sound encoding and processing abilities that result in the efficient detection, localization, and identification of sound sources in noisy environments. Many of the encoding and processing strategies underlying these functions are shared as well.},

  Abstract                 = {A laterally located sound source stimulates the two ears at slightly different times, generating interaural phase disparities (IPDs) that are used for sound localization. Under natural conditions, such interaural cues are likely to be constantly changing, or dynamic. In the inferior colliculus of gerbils and cats, the nonlinearities in the coding of dynamic interaural phase cues are demonstrated. Responses to ecologically realistic phase cues are more reflective of the change of IPD than of the absolute IPDs over which that change occurs. This observation is inconsistent with the established view that directional information is coded in terms of absolute IPD.},
