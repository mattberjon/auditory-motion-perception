# Auditory Motion Perception During Head Movement

Draft report about auditory motion perception during head movement.

This document is part of a PhD (not finished) on auditory motion perception 
during head and eyes movements. This work has been done inside the Action and
perception group of the Psych department of Cardiff University under the
supervision of Tom Freeman and John Culling.

This work isn't exhaustive and don't pretend to be but I share it for the
posterity of what I did during that period of time.

## Compilation

Initially in latex format, I decided to rewrite it using Sphinx that is more
adapted for an online version (LaTeX gives great printed output).

So, you need python 2.7 or 3.x with Sphinx and compile it using the following
command:

```bash
make html
```
