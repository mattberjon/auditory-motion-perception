Auditory Motion Perception
==========================

Auditory motion perception is of part of the audio field that remains quite 
unknown.

This report deals with several aspects of auditory motion perception during
head movements.

Rotating the head in front of a static sound creates dynamic changes in 
localisation cues that could be mistaken for a source that moves. To interpret 
these cues correctly, the listener must take the motion of the head into account. 
Geometrically, the angular velocity of a sound source in the world (:math:`S`)
is the sum of the velocity of head rotation (:math:`H`) and the angular
velocity of the source in the acoustic image :math:`(A): S = A + H`. Perceived
auditory motion is therefore determined by how well the auditory system
estimates A and H. We used a psychophysical motion-nulling technique in which
the lateral motion of a source was adjusted to determine the velocity at which
it appeared stationary during head rotation. If S is recovered veridically,
then null velocity should be 0.

Moving sounds were created using a cross-fading technique in which a white noise 
source was moved across a circular array of speakers by sweeping a spatial 
Gaussian weighting function. On each trial, a pursuit target swept left then 
right (or vice versa) followed by a moving test sound. Listeners tracked the 
pursuit target with their head as accurately as possible, and continued to do so 
unaccompanied during a third sweep in which the test source was presented. Six 
observers indicated whether the test source appeared to move left or right 
across the speakers. By varying the velocity of the test source according to a 
method of constant stimuli, the null point was estimated from the point of 
subjective equality of the psychometric function using Probit analysis. Pursuit 
target speeds of 20, 40, 60 deg/s were investigated. The duration and mean 
location of the test were randomised across trials to encourage judgements of 
velocity. Head velocity was recorded.

For all observers, the test sound had to move in the same direction but slower 
than the head rotation to appear stationary. Because the ability to track the 
pursuit target varied across observers, data were analysed on the basis of 
actual head rotation rather than target velocity. This revealed an approximately 
linear trend with a slope of 0.56. Thus, the test sound had to move around half 
the speed of the measured head rotation to achieve the null.

The results indicate that perceived motion during head rotation is not veridical; 
a stationary sound appears to move in the opposite direction to the head 
movement. H is therefore underestimated with respect to A. The result is similar 
to that obtained in vision.
